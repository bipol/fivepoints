`fivepoints` is `SMARTA`s window into the data we are collecting.

It is an API that will expose data living in dynamo, and in the future, likely other data sources.

## Why is this needed?
We are collecting a historical dataset of `MARTA` real-time data.  This will enable us to access it.

## How does it work?
If you have the right credentials, you should be able to access this like any other web API.

## Project Goals
- [ ] Expose the dynamo data in an endpoint that allows us to query event times for a certain station on a certain day

## Running

TBD
